# Integration tests for the runtimes.
This directory contains the integration test apps used to test the end-to-end functionality of the runtime images. You can use the [`test.sh`](../tools/test.sh) script to run the tests from your machine. The test will include deploying the app to Google App Engine Flexible and using the [integration tests framework](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/runtimes-common/tree/master/integration_tests) to verify that the app is functional. This means that you need to run with [gcloud](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/) configured correctly and with a project to which you can deploy Google App Engine Flexible environment apps.

The tests are run from the [`published`](./published) directory, where the .NET Core apps are published to by the [`update_integration_tests.sh`](../tools/update_integration_tests.sh) script. The source of the apps is stored in the [`apps`](./apps) directory. To update the tests then it is highly recommended that the [`update_integration_tests.sh`](../tools/update_integration_tests.sh) script is used, as it will take care of building and publishing to the right directory.

The test apps currently only implement the [Serving Root](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/runtimes-common/tree/master/integration_tests#serving-root) protocol to verify that the app is correctly deployed and serving traffic. More tests will be added soon.
