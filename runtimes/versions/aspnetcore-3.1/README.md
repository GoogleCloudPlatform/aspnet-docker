# .NET Core 3.1 Runtime
This directory contains the .NET Core 3.1 runtime. This runtime is a bit different than the other runtime in that it uses the .NET Core SDK (version 3.1.0) instead of the runtime to run the apps. This is done to be able to use the [runtime store](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/deploying/runtime-store) feature of the runtime, in which the system assemblies are stored in the deployment target (the app's Docker image) and therefore the app's publish directory doesn't need to include themn. These assemblies are only included with the .NET Core SDK.
